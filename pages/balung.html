            <h2>BALUNG PLANTATION</h2>
            <p>The Balung plantation is located in the south of Malaysia (Sabah region) on the island of Borneo.</p>
            <p>It was in the middle of the jungle that I worked for several months for this company. The main project for which I was asked unfortunately did not see the light of day. But ideas for future packaging as well as a magazine were born.</p>
            <p>With hours following the sun and very improvised working conditions, this experience had a visible impact on my way of approaching and treating a project according to its distribution area (social adaptation of a product).</p>
